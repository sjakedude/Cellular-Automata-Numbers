# Cellular-Automata-Numbers
This project is designed to simulate random number generation through cellular automata.

Currently the project will generate a random number based on the behavior of 100 cells in a 10 by 10 grid. The cells will behave according to a set of rules. See the comments in the code for the rules.

Currently we hae 3 rules that were made up randomly, but soon we will have just 1 rule to constitute the behavior of the cells.

When the simulation is done, the cells are all used in a large equation to calculate the random number.

Currently this entire project is a WIP, but the final result will be able to generate random numbers better than java or C++ methods.
